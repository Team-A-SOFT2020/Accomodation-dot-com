## How to use

We have created a Postman Collection, that you can use to interact with our application: https://github.com/Team-A-SOFT2020/Contract/blob/main/postman_collection.json



## CI/CD

We chose GitHub Action as our Continous Integration and Deployment tool.

GitHub Actions builds and process a pipeline using actions through .yml files. 

You can see our .yml file here: https://github.com/BenjaminHojgaard/Spring_CI_CD/blob/main/.github/workflows/aws.yml


The (major) steps in the pipeline goes like this:

 1. Sets up java and builds the program using maven
 2. Creates a Docker Image
 3. Pushes it to AWS ECR (our remote Docker repository) 
 4. Publishes the Docker Image on an EC2 instance
 




## Branching Strategy

We chose the branching strategy called "Feature Branching".
